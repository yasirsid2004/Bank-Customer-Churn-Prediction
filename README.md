# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
Project: Bank Customer Churn Prediction
This project predicts whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) or stay using Machine Learning (Logistic Regression).
ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement: Banks often lose customers without clear warning. By analyzing customer data, we can predict which customers are at risk of leaving, so the bank can take action to retain them.
ðŸ”¹ Dataset: The dataset contains customer details such as:
Credit Score
Age
Balance
Number of Products
Estimated Salary
Geography & Gender
And whether the customer churned or not (target variable).
ðŸ”¹ Approach:
Data Preprocessing
Handling missing values
Encoding categorical features (Geography, Gender)
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Model Building
Train-test split (80-20)
Logistic Regression model trained on customer data
Evaluation
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
Visualization
Confusion Matrix heatmap
Feature importance plot
Target distribution (Churned vs Not Churned)
Pairplot for selected features

ðŸ”¹ Results:
Achieved X% accuracy on test data (replace with your result).
Identified important features influencing churn (e.g., Age, Balance, Geography).

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Libraries
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion: This project demonstrates how machine learning can help banks predict customer churn and improve retention strategies. Logistic Regression provided interpretable results and highlighted the most influential customer features.
